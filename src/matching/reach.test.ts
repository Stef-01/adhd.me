/**
 * W221 follow-up: the lexicon's reach, measured and pinned.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A NUMBER IN A DOCUMENT. A one-off probe found the lexicon
 * reached nothing on nine of seventeen realistic queries and that ten tied exactly. Writing that
 * in the plan would have recorded it; it would not have stopped it coming back, and a
 * paraphrase-matching lexicon regresses silently — the tests all pass, the ranking still works,
 * and it quietly stops understanding anybody.
 *
 * THE CORPUS IS FIRST-PERSON AND DELIBERATELY NOT WRITTEN FROM THE LEXICON. Half of it is how
 * people actually describe these things: not "unhurried" but "I can never get a word in". If the
 * corpus were written by reading the lexicon it would measure nothing except that somebody can
 * copy a list, which is the trap that makes most coverage numbers meaningless.
 *
 * THE CEILING IS A RATCHET, NOT A TARGET. It is set just above where the lexicon actually sits so
 * a regression fails, and it is meant to be lowered as reach improves — never raised to make a
 * failing build pass. Raising it is how a control becomes a comment.
