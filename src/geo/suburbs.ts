// W211: where the practices are, and how far that is from the person searching.
//
//
// WHY THIS REPLACED A STRING. Every clinician carried a hardcoded `distance` like "4.8 km away",
// which is a distance from nowhere in particular. It rendered beside a match reason as though it
// had been calculated for the reader, and it had not: the same 4.8 km showed to somebody in the
// next street and somebody two suburbs over. On a directory whose whole promise is "a practice you
// can get to", a fabricated distance is the worst kind of wrong, because it is actionable.
//
// SUBURB, NOT ADDRESS, AND NOT THE DEVICE'S LOCATION. Two deliberate limits:
//
//   The person types a suburb or postcode. Nothing asks for geolocation, so there is no permission
//   prompt, no coordinate leaving the device and no location in any log. W183 makes the same call
//   for the clinician side: a suburb answers the question a patient is actually asking, and
//   precision beyond the question is disclosure without purpose.
//
//   Distances are STRAIGHT LINE and the surfaces say "about". A real travel time depends on the
//   train line, and a product that printed "12 min" without knowing the timetable would be making
//   the same fabricated-precision mistake in a new unit.
//
// THE TABLE IS SMALL AND HAND-WRITTEN because the demo roster covers two focus areas — Beecroft in
// northern Sydney (NSW) and the Gold Coast (QLD). A real deployment reads this from a gazetteer;
// the shape of the lookup is what matters here, and the test pins that every suburb a clinician
// claims is present, so a new practice in an unlisted suburb fails the suite rather than silently
// ranking last. The two areas are hundreds of kilometres apart on purpose: distances are always
// computed within an area, and a search resolves to whichever point the person names.
